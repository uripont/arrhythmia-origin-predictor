    "## 9. Final model evaluation and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the model is trained, we return to our constraints—one of which is high interpretability. We want to understand the model’s decisions so we can compare them to our existing biomedical knowledge. This is precisely why we avoided neural networks: interpreting their internal weights and activations is very difficult, and a black‐box approach offers little insight into how specific clinical variables drive each individual prediction. By using a tree‐based method like XGBoost, we can leverage post-hoc explanation techniques (such as SHAP) to quantify each feature’s contribution to the final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next step, we will compute feature-level importance scores for every prediction, highlighting which biomarkers, demographic factors, or lab results push the model toward one outcome or another. Once we have those importance scores, we can rank the top contributors for each patient and then aggregate them across a cohort to see which features the model relies on most overall. Finally, we’ll compare this model-derived ranking to the set of risk factors that clinicians typically consider—checking for both alignment (e.g., HbA1c or BMI appearing near the top) and any surprising discrepancies (e.g., a lab value clinicians don’t usually emphasize). By doing so, we ensure that our predictive pipeline not only performs well but also remains transparent, trustworthy, and grounded in real-world medical expertise."
